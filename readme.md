## Context:

- "Globally, an estimated 736 million women‚Äîalmost one in three‚Äîhave been subjected to physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual violence, or both at least once in their life (30 per cent of women aged 15 and older)." ([United Nations,2021](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures)) 

- "Globally 81,000 women and girls were killed in 2020, around 47,000 of them (58 per cent) died at the hands of an intimate partner or a family member, which equals to a woman or girl being killed every 11 minutes in their home." ([United Nations,2021](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures)) 

- "Violence against women is preventable. The health sector has an important role to play to provide comprehensive health care to women subjected to violence, and as an entry point for referring women to other support services they may need." ([World Health Organization,2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women)) 

- "The social and economic costs of intimate partner and sexual violence are enormous and have ripple effects throughout society. Women may suffer isolation, inability to work, loss of wages, lack of participation in regular activities and limited ability to care for themselves and their children." ([World Health Organization,2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women)) 

- "Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world." ([United Nations,2022](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/)) 

- "In the future, 90% of all jobs will require STEM related skills and women must possess skills and education to be competitive in the future employment market." ([UNOOSA,2021](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1102082)) 

- "The number of women employed in the international space industry represents just 20-22 percent of the workforce, according to figures released by the UN; roughly the same proportion as 30 years ago."  ([UNOOSA,2021](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1102082))

- "Over 560 people have traveled to space, but less than 70 of them are women. Of the 225 spacewalks that have been taken, only 15 were by women." ([UNOOSA,2021](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1102082))
